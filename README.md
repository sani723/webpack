# Introduction to webpack

This is sort of a cookbook of how to get things done with webpack. Start with this guide as your webpack docs, then dig into the official docs for more high-level information on the core notions behind webpack.

## What is webpack?

> webpack is a module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it recursively builds a dependency graph that includes every module your application needs, then packages all of those modules into a small number of bundles - often only one - to be loaded by the browser. and it is incredibly configurable.

Ok in plain words, from the very core thing `webpack is simply a program that compiles one JavaScript file into another`.

In order to do this run following command in your terminal.
```
web pack app.js build.js
```
app.js - name of the file that you want to be compiled
build.js - name of the file that you want app.js compiled into


webpack provides number of different features including 
* module bundling
* file minification
* sass compilation 
* and much much more 

Being able to use these features not only makes developing website easier but also helps to optimize your code so that you have efficient and blazing fast websites.
