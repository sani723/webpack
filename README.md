# Introduction to webpack

This is sort of a cookbook of how to get things done with webpack. Start with this guide as your webpack docs, then dig into the official docs for more high-level information on the core notions behind webpack.

## What is webpack?

> webpack is a module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it recursively builds a dependency graph that includes every module your application needs, then packages all of those modules into a small number of bundles - often only one - to be loaded by the browser. and it is incredibly configurable.

Ok in simple worlds, from the very core thing <code>"webpack is simply a program that compiles one JavaScript file into another"</code>.
